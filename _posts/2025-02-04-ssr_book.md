In this book, Thomas Kuhn discusses the notion of scientific progress by proposing that revolutionary ideas do not arise from a day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation, but rather occur outside normal science.

In most, if not all, scientific research, everything starts with a paradigm. This can be defined as a framework of accepted theories, methods, and standards that define scientific practice during a certain period. For instance, in an early astronomical discussion, Ptolemaic system considers Earth as the centre of the “observable universe”. Every upcoming discussion at that time tries to make sense of other planetary motions with respect to Earth. The author calls the use of a certain paradigm normal science. During the practices of normal science, anomalies will be observed and the existing paradigm will fail to explain it. Along the line, the anomalies are accumulated and it leads to crisis, undermining the confidence in the paradigm and prompting for alternatives.

In the context of astronomical discussion, the geocentric paradigm comes to an end when Galileo proved the Copernican model, where the sun is the centre of our system. The shift from geocentric to heliocentric model is an example of paradigm shift explained in the book. This shift is non-cumulative, to arrive to this new paradigm means abandoning the previous one. With the newly proposed paradigm, debates comparing the old and the new one will exist until the scientific community arrive to a new consensus on which school of thought is more justifiable. Afterward, this new paradigm is commonly practised, this then become the “new normal” in science.

This book offers an interesting historical view of how science makes progress. The book offers different examples of how our understanding of motion changes from Aristoteles, Galileo, Newton, to Einstein. One drawback of this book is the lack of cohesivity between paragraphs. The transition feels a bit odd, instead of being driven by the writer, readers must connect the dots by themselves. I would still recommend this book for researchers, especially PhD students.
